# Playdates For Peace

# Website that is for my local area, where single parents and/or stay at home parents can register/login and see/set playdates. Basic information, event details, time, location. Parents can log in and choose to attend or not. I don’t want to show names of those who plan to attend just yet as I’m unsure how I’d go about the site later on with still maintaining safety of children/adults meeting.
